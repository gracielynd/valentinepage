          <h4>Happy Single's Awareness Day!</h4>
          <p>
            Just because it's Valentine's Day, and you don't have a valentine, doesn't mean you should be "in [your] bedroom, making no noise and pretending [you] don't exist", unless that's what you really want. Instead, you can get with a group of friends to celebrate what many like to call "Single's Awareness Day"! In fact: Brigham City Half-Axed has the Valentine's Date Night on February 13th, and is celebrating the singles on Sunday, the 14th this year. After talking to one of the co-owners, it's because axe-throwing is great when you have a lot of pent-up emotions (like anger) and putting your heart into throwing an axe is a great reliever of stress for some people.
          </p>

            If you feel like you're missing out on the gifts and love associated with Valentine's Day, get with your best friend(s) and give each other gifts and candy! Go on a group outing just to have fun together and take your mind off the fact that you're single (if it's really bugging you). Friends know each other well, and can be uplifting to your mental health on "Single's Awareness Day".

            It may be a little ironic that "Single's Awarness Day" is abrivated as "SAD"...
